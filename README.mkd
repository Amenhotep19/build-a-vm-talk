# Let's Build A Virtual Machine!

Code and slides from my Hey!Stac talk at the Belgrave in Leeds on the 28th of October 2014.

"the-go-version.go" is the version written during the talk - warts and all!

Provided you have Go installed, you can run it by like this:

    ▶ go run the-go-version.go

"the-php-version.php" is from a practice run I did the day before the talk, and is provided for comparison. You can run it like this:

    ▶ php the-php-version.php

Thanks to all that came :)
